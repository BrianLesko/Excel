# Excel
Created by and contaning work by Brian Lesko.
This repository, contains projects created in Microsoft Excel. Created on 12/28/2022 to document a 2019 project for Solar Flex Rack, with proprietary information scrubbed, these files serve to document work I am proud of. (Although I would have rather completed this project in C++ or MATLAB at the time)
